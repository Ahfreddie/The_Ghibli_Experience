            Studio Ghibli is one of the world&apos;s most iconic animation
            houses. Established in 1985, this Japanese studio has left a lasting
            mark with stories that blend breathtaking visuals, masterful
            storytelling, unforgettable characters, and a wide range of
            meaningful themes. Even with the rise and dominance of CGI
            animation, Ghibli has continued to craft its worlds through
            traditional 2D artistry.
            <br />
            This page is my notebook — a collection of my observations on how
            Ghibli portrays love through the 2D medium, two forms of art that
            have become rare in modern animated media. Join me as I explore what
            makes these 2D love stories stand out from conventional fairytale
            romances, and how Ghibli approaches them with depth, subtlety, and
            heart.

            <h2>Where This Journey Begins</h2>
            <p>
              This all started with a conversation — one of those quiet,
              thoughtful ones — about how Disney shifted from 2D animation into
              fully embracing 3D, and how love stories in modern Disney films
              feel different from the classic fairy-tale era. Romance used to be
              loud, central, and unapologetic. Today, it often feels… careful.
            </p>
            <p>
              It seems like modern Disney has been intentionally stepping away
              from the obvious tropes — the love at first sight, the idea that a
              girl&apos;s purpose is fulfilled by Prince Charming. Films like
              Frozen and Tangled openly poke fun at these ideas: true
              love&apos;s kiss doesn&apos;t work the way it once did, and the
              heroine doesn&apos;t automatically fall for the handsome stranger
              who appears out of nowhere. And while there&apos;s nothing wrong
              with the stories being told today, it personally felt like a
              hesitation — almost a fear — of telling genuine, grounded love
              stories where romance isn&apos;t secondary or ironic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Which is interesting, because Disney has done this beautifully
              before. The Aristocats, for example, tells a warm, simple love
              story that doesn&apos;t try too hard — it just lets the
              relationship grow naturally.
            </p>
            <p>That&apos;s when I started thinking about Studio Ghibli.</p>
            <p>
              At the time, I had only seen a handful of Ghibli films, but every
              one of them approached love in a quiet, meaningful way. Not loud.
              Not announced. Just felt. It made me wonder why most Western
              studios don&apos;t approach love like this — stories that focus on
              connection, trust, and presence. Stories that don&apos;t tell us
              “this is a love story”, but show us through small moments, shared
              silences, and gentle growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              A perfect example is Ponyo, where love is explored through the
              innocence of children. It never over-romanticizes the feeling, yet
              it clearly shows what matters — care, loyalty, and sincerity —
              without forcing a message or pushing an agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
              That, to me, is the magic of Ghibli. The studio tells deeply human
              stories, often in 2D animation — a medium many major studios have
              left behind in favor of flashy CGI (which isn&apos;t a bad thing).
              But there&apos;s something special about how much emotion, warmth,
              and meaning Ghibli expresses through this format.
            </p>
            <p>
              So I decided to explore Ghibli&apos;s love stories more
              intentionally. I made a list of films where love plays a central
              role, with a simple goal: to truly understand what sets these
              stories apart, to appreciate the beauty of grounded love, and to
              see how 2D animation can still be a powerful way to tell stories
              that matter.
